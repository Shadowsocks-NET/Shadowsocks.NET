## Usage

- ðŸš€

## PAC

- The PAC rules are generated from the geosite database in [v2fly/domain-list-community](https://github.com/v2fly/domain-list-community).
- Generation modes: whitelist mode and blacklist mode.
- Domain groups: `geositeDirectGroups` and `geositeProxiedGroups`.
    - `geositeDirectGroups` is initialized with `cn` and `geolocation-!cn@cn`.
    - `geositeProxiedGroups` is initialized with `geolocation-!cn`.
- To switch between different modes, modify the `geositePreferDirect` property in `gui-config.json`
    - When `geositePreferDirect` is false (default), PAC works in whitelist mode. Exception rules are generated from `geositeDirectGroups`. Unmatched domains goes through the proxy.
    - When `geositePreferDirect` is true, PAC works in blacklist mode. Blocking rules are generated from `geositeProxiedGroups`. Exception rules are generated from `geositeDirectGroups`. Unmatched domains are connected to directly.
- Starting from 4.3.0.0, shadowsocks-windows defaults to whitelist mode with Chinese domains excluded from connecting via the proxy.
- The new default values make sure that:
    - When in whitelist mode, Chinese domains, including non-Chinese companies' Chinese CDNs, are connected to directly.
    - When in blacklist mode, only non-Chinese domains goes through the proxy. Chinese domains, as well as non-Chinese companies' Chinese CDNs, are connected to directly.

### User-defined rules

- To define your own PAC rules, it's recommended to use the `user-rule.txt` file.
- You can also modify `pac.txt` directly. But your modifications won't persist after updating geosite from the upstream.

## Development

- Language: C# 9.0
- SDK: .NET 5
